            Whether you join us for one night, two nights, or just Saturday, we’ll be thrilled to have you!</p>

      <h2>The Region</h2>
      <p>Our wedding will take place in beautiful area of northern Spain. The Pyrenees offer mountain views, rich history, and charming villages.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Isín is a restored, once-abandoned Pyrenean village. We’ll have it to ourselves!</li>
            <li>Sabiñánigo (7 miles to Isín) is a small, convenient town with great transport connections.</li>
            <li>Jaca (14 miles to Isín), slightly further, is a gem with medieval streets and lovely scenery.</li>

    <section id="travel">
        <h2>Getting here</h2>
        <p>The town of Sabiñánigo is accessible via train and coach/bus from Zaragoza, Huesca, and Pamplona (all of which are on main train lines). 
            <br/>
            From there, it’s a short drive to Isín by taxi —or we’ll gladly help coordinate lifts with local friends!
            <br/>
            By car it’s about 3.5h from Barcelona and Bilbao, 1.5h from Zaragoza or a little over 4h from Madrid and Toulouse.
            <br/>
            So for flights, consider <b>Zaragoza, Bilbao, Barcelona, Madrid</b> or even <b>Toulouse</b> as options.</p>
            
            For ferries consider Bilbao and Santander<ul>

    <section id="accommodation">
        <h2>Accommodation</h2>
        <p>We’ve booked the whole village! Basic on-site options include:

            <ul>
                <li>A youth hostel with shared rooms (4-8 beds). We’ll obviously keep families and friends together.
                </li>
                <li>Apartments (3-11 people) reserved for older guests and families with younger kids.
                </li>
            </ul>
             
            This accommodation is a budget option at just 15€ per person/night —just let us know if you’d like to stay there. <br/>Breakfast will also be included there, or you can make the most of the mornings and explore the area.
          
          
            <p> Other nearby options include hotels, B&Bs, campsites, cabins and apartments. Sabiñánigo is the closest, while Jaca offers a more scenic option.</p>

        <section id="dress">
            <h2>What to wear</h2>
            Although we're celebrating in the beautiful countryside, we want you to bring your A-game and dress to impress, while staying comfy. 
            <br/>
            Dress? Think elegant! This is your chance to dust off those ex-bridesmaid or prom dresses, bring out that dress you've been wanting to wear on a special occasion! <br>
            Shoes! Just remember, it's a bit hilly, so opt for flat or small heels to avoid any unplanned acrobatics. 
            <br>
            Suit? We want you suited and booted, but don’t worry, tuxedos are not required. A nice suit will do the trick. 
            <br/>
            Temperature wise we expect it to be warm (around 20ºC average, max 25º), but to cool down in the evenings (min 13º). <br/>
            Isín gets about 6 rainy days in September, on average, so we've got a good chance of dry weather.
